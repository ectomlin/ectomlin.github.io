<h1><strong>Biograhy</strong></h1>
<body>

<p> My name is Eric Tomlinson and I am from Raleigh, NC. However, I grew up in 
Louisburg, NC on a horse farm with my three older brothers. I lived in Louisburg
for 14 years until my family bought a house in Raleigh so we could be closer to 
school. We had always gone to school in Raleigh but living in Louisburg required
 us to drive an hour each way to get there. Once we moved school was only a few
 minutes away.</p>
 
 <p> In highshool I enjoyed playing varsity soccer as well as track and field.
 In soccer I was played the postion of striker and was a team captain my junior
 and senior year. In track I ran the 400m, 4X400m, 200m and triple jump. My
 senior year I finished my senior year as the 9th ranked triple jumper in the 2A
 division. I was also involved in student council, where I was a class 
 representative my freshmen - junior year and class treaserer my senior year.</p>
 
 <p> My first year of college I attended NCSU before transfering to UNC. Once I
 had transfered to UNC for my sophmore year I set my mind on pursuing business
 through the Kenan Flagler Business School. On campus I became involved with the 
 transfer community through Peer Mentoring as well as joined Sigma Nu Fraternity. 
 In Sigma Nu I am the Chaplain of the fraternity and work to organize brotherhood 
 events during the semester.I am also a Peer Mentor to transfer students through 
 C-STEP Peer Mentoring where I am able to help guide incoming tranfer students as
 the acclimate to the UNC community.</p>
