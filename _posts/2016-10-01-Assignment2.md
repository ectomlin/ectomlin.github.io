<p> Since I first began IDST 161 I have come a long way from where I began. However, seeing as
I started with no coding experience at all, that does not mean much. Since I first began 
I have learned about the command line, git/github, markdown, HTML, CSS and more. In this blog
post I will go over some of these topics and explain them as I have understood them.</p>
<h3><strong>Command Line</strong></h3>
<p> Through a terminal we are able to access the SHELL which is an interface for the command line.
By typing in the command line we can navigate and pull information quickly from the shell. The three
commands that we have used the most have been
<br>
<ul>
<li>pwd</li>
<li>ls</li>
<li>cd</li>
</ul>
<br>
pwd tells us our working directory, ls lists the files in the working directory and cd
changes our working directory.
<br>
<h3><strong>Git/GITHUB</strong></h3>
Git is a version control system that allows us to track our changes and manage workflow. Git 
has multiple usages including a branching system that allows you develope isolated features. Github
is a site that allows you to host your repositories while incourageing collaboration.
<br>
<h3><strong>Markdown</strong></h3>
<br>
Mardown is a markup language that allows you to write in a plain text format that can
be converted into other markup languages such as HTML, which is the way I am using it.
